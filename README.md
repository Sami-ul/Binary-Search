# Binary-Search
#### The binary search algorithm is an algorithm that works by repeatedly halving the list in order to find the desired item in a list faster than a normal sequential search. This algorithm requires that the list be sorted.

#### About the first 25 lines of this project is the actual binary search, and everything after is the output and setup so that we can fill the functions parameters with a random sorted list.
